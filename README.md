# Git for Developer
In this repo, I will learn git knowledge at first and figure out how to use that tool in my whole developer path in the future
## Resource
Looking for some reference source to learn below:
    - https://learngitbranching.js.org
    - Version Control with Git - Udacity
     
### 1. Basic Git knowledge
a. Introduction to Git Commit
- Git commit is likely snapshot of changing in initial version of file in your folder.
- Git store all historial commit with commit time

Git commit


b. Branching in Git
- It just like a cursor to focus on commit??
- It help divide work into multiple piece of branch and easily develop and combine all changing in multiple version in branching into one

##### Step 1: Create naming of branch:

Git branch <name-branch>

##### Step 2: Move to branch

Git checkout <name-branch>

##### Step 3: Save previos commit into new branch 

Git commit

#### Note: 
- In Git version 2.23: New command git switch can equal git checkout
- If you want to create brach and move in one step (combine Step 1 + 2), just need to use command 
Git checkout -b <name-branch>

c. Merging in Git



d. Rebase Introduction
