# Git and Markdown writing for Developer
In this repo, I will learn git knowledge at first and figure out how to use that tool in my whole developer path in the future.
Also, to be professional developer in the future, writing skills in markdown file is one of important factor that I will mention in README file.
## Resource
Looking for some reference source to learn below:

## Table of Content

     
### 1. Basic Git knowledge
a. Introduction to Git Commit
- Git commit is likely snapshot of changing in initial version of file in your folder.
- Git store all historial commit with commit time

Git commit


b. Branching in Git
- It just like a cursor to focus on commit??
- It help divide work into multiple piece of branch and easily develop and combine all changing in multiple version in branching into one

##### Step 1: Create naming of branch:

Git branch <name-branch>

##### Step 2: Move to branch

Git checkout <name-branch>

##### Step 3: Save previos commit into new branch 

Git commit

#### Note: 
- In Git version 2.23: New command git switch can equal git checkout
- If you want to create brach and move in one step (combine Step 1 + 2), just need to use command 
Git checkout -b <name-branch>

c. Merging in Git
- It help us to combine all function we develop on branch with origin function in main



d. Rebase Introduction

- Rebase command use to copy commit from branching into main and will merge with main after using rebase again
